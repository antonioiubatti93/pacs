This is challenge 2.2.
Eliminated some functions provided in Polygon.hpp for simplicity.
The class AbstractPolygon contains the minimal setting.
Print the help with
	./main -h [--help]
for more information.

Up to now: I thimnk there is a problem in deallocating the bare pointer in class AbstractPolygon.
I did not manage to fix the bug, but the method area() actually works. Sorry :(
